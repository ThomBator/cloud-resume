            <p>
              Hi, my name is Thom! I'm recently completed the B.S. computer
              science program at Western Governors University. During my degree
              program, I gained experience creating desktop and web
              applications. I also learned the fundamentals about operating
              systems, networks, data-structures and algorithms, discrete math,
              machine learning and more. Since graduation, I've been working
              hard to continue developing my skills. My coding journey has been
              one of the most rewarding of my life, and I can't wait to find the
              right company to continue it with!

            <summary>Senior Copywriter turned Dev</summary>
            <p>
              I left my full-time position as a Senior Copywriter when I decided
              to pursue a CS degree full-time. Before that, I worked at the same
              agency for almost 9 years. During this time I developed brand
              strategies, and helped create award-winning marketing campaigns. I
              wrote web/blog content, video scripts, presentations, brochures,
              emails and even a few holiday cards! I'm still freelance
              copywriting a bit as I look for my first developer role. You can
              view my previous copywriting work and testimonials
              <a href="https://www.advancedcopywriting.com/">here.</a> If you
              need a developer that can also contribute a little writing, I
              could be a great fit!

            <summary>Why I Changed Careers</summary>
            <p>
              A lot of people have asked me why I made such a big career change.
              The truth is that even though I loved a lot of things about my
              role, I felt I was missing something. You see, copywriting gave me
              a chance to fulfill my creative side, but I've always had a deep
              love for technical and analytical problems too. My wife told me to
              go for it! So I enrolled at WGU and haven't looked back. Now that
              I've earned my degree, I'm excited to find my first developer
              role.
